This project tackles Urban Heat Island (UHI) prediction in NYC using a multi-stage approach. Initially, traditional machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost) on a diverse dataset revealed key feature importances: air temperature surpassed LST, and building metrics proved more indicative than simple LULC indices. We then conducted a feature importance strategy to inform the development of deep learning models. A static feedforward model, tested with random data splits, showed the Clay Vision Transformer (validation *R²* = 0.63) outperforming LULC indices (*R²* = 0.40). Recognizing random splitting’s limitations for heteroskedastic temporal data, sequential splitting was emphasized, under which the static model’s performance significantly dropped (best validation *R²* = 0.16 using LST). Our main deep learning contribution, a branched temporal model using Clay for static features and ConvLSTM for dynamic weather sequences, achieved a validation *R²* = 0.11 on sequential data. This work highlights the challenges of UHI prediction with sparse data and proposes a deep learning pipeline with foundation models as a promising approach for spatiotemporal environmental forecasting.
