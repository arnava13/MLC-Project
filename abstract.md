Urban Heat Islands (UHI) exacerbate climate-related risks, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations in densely populated cities. This study develops a end-to-end deep learning approach to predict UHI intensity at a micro-scale across New York City, leveraging ground-level air temperature data, satellite imagery (Sentinel-2 and Landsat), building footprint data, and local weather conditions. Within each grid cell of a defined scaled in the city,  we combine these features in a transformer architecture to conduct a cell-wise time series prediction of surface temperatures. In order to do this, we conduct feature engineering on the satellite data using semantic segmentation models from computer vision. This is done against a causal framework, where we use a Perlian SCM to separate and quantify the causal effects of weather conditions and geography. We then conduct ablations and hyperparameter search in order to maximise the coefficient of determination $R^2$ against a open validation dataset. The results will provide a scalable and interpretable framework for urban planners and policymakers to mitigate extreme heat effects through informed decision-making. This research is conducted as part of the 2025 EY Open Science AI & Data Challenge and contributes to broader efforts in climate resilience and sustainable urban development, and the datasets are obtained accordingly.
