### Major difficulty
Some useful datsets require approval from the data provider. <br>
How to adjust data from reports with remote sensing data? <br>
It is difficult to definitively determine whether it is due to the company's location or the nature of its business.<br>
It seems very hard to distinguish the impact of a company's business on the environment due to the geoggraphic scales and other environmental factors.
